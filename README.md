React-tac-toe
----
Simple tic-tac-toe game written using React as view layer.


Build the app
----

I've included the `/build` directory so no build should be necessary,
however, if you really want to...

1] Make sure you have gulp installed. To be safe do it globally.

    npm install glup -g

2] Run npm install to get the project deps

3] Start a simple Python server like this:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000

4] Visit the site at http://localhost:3000

5] Should you want to make edits to this project run

    gulp watch
